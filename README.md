Abstract: This repository shows how to build a SOLID application to fetch/create/modify data in your SOLID Pod, start a data request (for research), and participate in researchers' data request. This is my first SOLID application built in a very limited time. I will learn from others and improve it step by step. Welcome to contact me if you have any questions :)
